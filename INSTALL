Basic Installation
==================

        AcritoxInstaller uses the cmake build system. The simple instructions for
building acritoxinstaller are these commands:

                        mkdir ../acritoxinstaller-build && cd ../acritoxinstaller-build
                        cmake ../acritoxinstaller
                        make
                        make install

        Some components of acritoxinstaller may have dependencies. If these
are not met when the 'cmake' command is run, those components will not be
built. The output of 'cmake' should make it clear what these dependencies are
and how to meet them.

        Arguments can be given to cmake similar to those given to a traditional
configure script, like the install prefix. See 'cmake --help-full' for more
information. For example, 'configure --prefix=/usr/lib' translates to
'cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/lib'.
